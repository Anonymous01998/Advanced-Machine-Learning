# Advanced-Machine-Learning

Abstract:
 This project focuses on the application of Data Mining and Machine Learning in order to build a strong classification models that can identify the important attributes of voters whom are essential for the winning percentage of the candidates. 
 Various classification techniques are used in this project including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC, and KNN. The best model among these are chosen by it's highest accuracy, F1, and recall.
 
 Goal:
 Using the several of the Machine Learning model, a strong classification models are built in order to,
 identify the features that are of important in order to predict the election results of 2016.
 
 Dataset:
      1. The dataset link is given at the top.
      2. The dataset consists of 3143 observations by county
      3. Since some of the features are irrelavent to the project, those are dropped during the analysis
